    "longDescription": "There's a great deal of wisdom in a crowd, but how do you listen to a thousand people talking at once  Identifying the wants, needs, and knowledge of internet users can be like listening to a mob.    In the Web 2.0 era, leveraging the collective power of user contributions, interactions, and feedback is the key to market dominance. A new category of powerful programming techniques lets you discover the patterns, inter-relationships, and individual profiles   the collective intelligence   locked in the data people leave behind as they surf websites, post blogs, and interact with other users.    Collective Intelligence in Action is a hands-on guidebook for implementing collective-intelligence concepts using Java. It is the first Java-based book to emphasize the underlying algorithms and technical implementation of vital data gathering and mining techniques like analyzing trends, discovering relationships, and making predictions. It provides a pragmatic approach to personalization by combining content-based analysis with collaborative approaches.    This book is for Java developers implementing collective intelligence in real, high-use applications. Following a running example in which you harvest and use information from blogs, you learn to develop software that you can embed in your own applications. The code examples are immediately reusable and give the Java developer a working collective intelligence toolkit.    Along the way, you work with, a number of APIs and open-source toolkits including text analysis and search using Lucene, web-crawling using Nutch, and applying machine learning algorithms using WEKA and the Java Data Mining (JDM) standard.",

This book takes you on an over-the-shoulder tour of the components of the Zend Framework as you build a high quality, real-world web application.",
    "longDescription": "From rather humble beginnings as the Personal Home Page scripting language, PHP has found its way into almost every server, corporation, and dev shop in the world. On an average day, somewhere between 500,000 and 2 million coders do something in PHP. Even when you use a well-understood language like PHP, building a modern web application requires tools that decrease development time and cost while improving code quality. Frameworks such as Ruby-on-Rails and Django have been getting a lot of attention as a result.     For PHP coders, the Zend Framework offers that same promise without the need to move away from PHP. This powerful collection of components can be used in part or as a whole to speed up the development process. Zend Framework has the backing of Zend Technologies; the driving force behind the PHP programming language in which it is written. The first production release of the Zend Framework became available in July of 2007.    Zend Framework in Action is a comprehensive tutorial that shows how to use the Zend Framework to create web-based applications and web services. This book takes you on an over-the-shoulder tour of the components of the Zend Framework as you build a high quality, real-world web application. This book is organized around the techniques you'll use every day as a web developer \"data handling, forms, authentication, and so forth. As you follow the running example, you'll learn to build interactive Ajax-driven features into your application without sacrificing nuts-and-bolts considerations like security and performance.  This book is aimed at the competent PHP developer who wants to master framework-driven web development. Zend Framework in Action goes beyond the docs but still provides quick access to the most common topics encountered in the development of web applications.  ",

The software systems they're using have been carefully selected and built from the ground up to work together seamlessly. There are no legacy systems, data, or competing business concerns to manage.    Cut to reality.    You're a Java developer. The marketing guy tells you that \"corporate\" wants a Flex-based site and you have to deliver it on top of what you already have. Your budget  Don't even ask. \"Make it look like the Discovery channel or something.\"    Flex on Java assumes you live in the real world   not the demo. This unique book shows you how to refactor an existing web application using the server-side you already know. You'll learn to use Flex 3 in concert with Spring, EJB 3, POJOs, JMS, and other standard technologies. Wherever possible, the examples use free or open source software.    The authors start with a typical Java web app and show you how to add a rich Flex interface. You also learn how to integrate Flex into your server-side Java via the BlazeDS framework, Adobe's open-source remoting and web messaging technology for Flex.    The book shows you how to deploy to not only the web but also to the desktop using the Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR). You will learn how to integrate Flex into your existing applications in order to build a next generation application that will delight users.    Flex on Java is approachable for anyone beginning Java and Flex development.    ",

    "longDescription": "Although several options exist for interface development in Java, even popular UI toolkits like Swing have been notoriously complex and difficult to use. Griffon, an agile framework that uses Groovy to simplify Swing, makes UI development dramatically faster and easier. In many respects, Griffon is for desktop development what Grails is for web development. While it's based on Swing, its declarative style and approachable level of abstraction is instantly familiar to developers familiar with other technologies such as Flex or JavaFX.

One of the troublesome parts of Swing development is the amount of Java code that is required to get a simple application off the ground.    You'll learn how SwingBuilder (and its cousin builders) present a very palatable alternative in the form of a DSL geared towards building graphical user interfaces. Pair it up with the convention over configuration paradigm, a well tested and tried application source structure (based on Grails) and you have a recipe for quick and effective Swing application development. Griffon in Action covers declarative view development, like the one provided by JavaFX Script, as well as the structure, architecture and life cycle of Java application development",

Enterprise OSGi addresses several shortcomings of existing enterprise platforms, such as allowing the creation of better maintainable and extensible applications, and provide a simpler, easier-to-use, light-weight solution to enterprise software development.",
    "longDescription": "A good application framework greatly simplifies a developer's task by providing reusable code modules that solve common, tedious, or complex tasks. Writing a great framework requires an extraordinary set of skills-ranging from deep knowledge of a programming language and target platform to a crystal-clear view of the problem space where the applications to be developed using the framework will be used.    OSGi Application Frameworks shows a Java developer how to build frameworks based on the OSGi service platform. OSGi, an emerging Java-based technology for developing modular applications, is a great tool for framework building. A framework itself, OSGi allows the developer to create a more intuitive, modular framework by isolating many of the key challenges the framework developer faces.    This book begins by describing the process, principles, and tools you must master to build a custom application framework. It introduces the fundamental concepts of OSGi, and then shows you how to put OSGi to work building various types of frameworks that solve specific development problems.    OSGi is particularly useful for building frameworks that can be easily extended by developers to create domain-specific applications. This book teaches the developer to break down a problem domain into its abstractions and then use OSGi to create a modular framework solution. Along the way, the developer learns software engineering practices intrinsic to framework building that result in systems with better software qualities, such as flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability.    Author Alexandre Alves guides you through major concepts, such as the definition of programming models and modularization techniques, and complements them with samples that have real applicability using industry-proved technologies, such as Spring-DM and Equinox.",

    "shortDescription": "\"Flexible Rails created a standard to which I hold other technical books. You definitely get your money's worth.\"",
    "longDescription": "Rails is a fantastic tool for web application development, but its Ajax-driven interfaces stop short of the richness you gain with a tool like Adobe Flex. Simply put, Flex is the most productive way to build the UI of rich Internet applications, and Rails is the most productive way to rapidly build a database-backed CRUD application. Together, they're an amazing combination.    Flexible Rails is a book about how to use Ruby on Rails and Adobe Flex to build next-generation rich Internet applications (RIAs). The book takes you to the leading edge of RIA development, presenting examples in Flex 3 and Rails 2.    This book is not an exhaustive Ruby on Rails tutorial, nor a Flex reference manual. (Adobe ships over 3000 pages of PDF reference documentation with Flex.) Instead, it's an extensive tutorial, developed iteratively, how to build an RIA using Flex and Rails together. You learn both the specific techniques you need to use Flex and Rails together as well as the development practices that make the combination especially powerful.    The example application built in the book is MIT-licensed, so readers can use it as the basis for their own applications. In fact, one reader has already built an agile project management tool based on the book example!    With this book, you learn Flex by osmosis. You can read the book and follow along even if you have never used Flex before. Consider it \"Flex Immersion.\" You absorb the key concepts of Flex as you go through the process of building the application.    You will also learn how Flex and Rails integrate with HTTPService and XML, and see how RESTful Rails controller design gracefully supports using the same controller actions for Flex and HTML clients. The author will show you how Cairngorm can be used to architect larger Flex applications, including tips to use Cairngorm in a less verbose way with HTTPService to talk to Rails.    Flexible Rails is for both Rails developers who are interested in Flex, and Flex developers who are interested in Rails. For a Rails developer, Flex allows for more dynamic and engaging user interfaces than are possible with Ajax. For a Flex developer, Rails provides a way to rapidly build the ORM and services layer of the application.",

    "longDescription": "In complex software projects, managing the development process can be as critical to success as writing the code itself. A project may involve dozens of developers, managers, architects, testers, and customers, hundreds of builds, and thousands of opportunities to get off-track. To keep tabs on the people, tasks, and components of a medium- to large-scale project, most teams use a development system that allows for easy monitoring, follow-up, and accountability.    Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2008 (TFS), the server component of Microsoft's Visual Studio Team System (VSTS), provides a powerful collaborative platform for software-development teams. The product offers an integrated toolset for tracking work items, creating test cases, managing source code, generating builds, constructing database schemas, and so on. Because in software development one size does not fit all, TFS provides process customization, project management, and reporting capabilities to build solutions around your requirements.    Team Foundation Server 2008 in Action is a hands-on guide to Team Foundation Server 2008. Written for developers with a good handle on TFS basics, this book shows you how to solve real-life problems. It's not a repetition of Microsoft's product documentation. Team Foundation Server 2008 in Action is a practitioner's handbook for how to work with TFS under common constraints. This book walks you through real-life software engineering problems based on hundreds of hours of TFS experience.    You'll benefit from expert author Jamil Azher's extensive interactions with members of Microsoft's TFS team and MVPs, survey feedback from the author's blog, and interviews with organizations and user groups using TFS. Instead of just offering a high-level overview, the book provides detailed solutions for solving common   and not-so-common   problems using TFS. It discusses the strengths as well as weaknesses of TFS, and suggests appropriate problem resolution steps, workarounds, or custom solutions.",

    "longDescription": "It's easy to get excited about building a new software project from scratch. So-called \"greenfield\" projects often involve learning new technology and the opportunity for experimentation. Working on established software projects may seem less glamorous.    Most software developers have inherited a monolithic application where the day-to-day tasks involve maintenance, incremental improvements, or even cleaning up the mess another programmer left behind. These legacy or brownfield projects often have tightly coupled components, low cohesion, and poor separation of concerns, making them fragile and resistant to change.    Brownfield Application Development in .Net shows you how to approach legacy applications with the state-of-the-art concepts, patterns, and tools you've learned to apply to new projects. Using an existing application as an example, this book guides you in applying the techniques and best practices you need to make it more maintainable and receptive to change.    Starting with the build process and the introduction of unit tests, the authors show you how to set up the application so that in later chapters, you can make incremental changes aimed at decoupling components from each other. Each practice introduced will increase your confidence and ability to make subsequent changes to your code.    As the book proceeds, the authors introduce frameworks and tools commonly used today while still approaching the subject from a conceptual level so that you can substitute alternate tools as appropriate. This book examines the reasons why a tool is necessary, not the tool itself. Because the book is based on the authors' experiences, Brownfield Application Development in .Net moves beyond the theories and shows you the techniques you need to be successful.",

Emphasis is on standalone and web-based business applications, such as for online sales and mass customization, but much of what this book offers has broad applicability to 3D user interfaces in other pursuits such as scientific visualization and gaming.  This book provides an extensive conceptual framework for 3D user interface techniques, and an in-depth introduction to user interface support in the Java 3D API, including such topics as picking, collision, and drag-and-drop. Many of the techniques are demonstrated in a Java 3D software framework included with the book, which also provides developers with many general-purpose building blocks for constructing their own user interfaces.    Applications and their use of 3D are approached realistically. The book is geared towards sophisticated user interfaces for the \"everyday user\" who doesn't have a lot of time to learn another application--much less a complicated one--and an everyday computer system without exotic devices like head mounted displays and data gloves. Perhaps the best description of this book is: \"A roadmap from Java 3D to 'Swing 3D'.\"",

    "longDescription": "Hibernate practically exploded on the Java scene. Why is this open-source tool so popular  Because it automates a tedious task: persisting your Java objects to a relational database. The inevitable mismatch between your object-oriented code and the relational database requires you to write code that maps one to the other. This code is often complex, tedious and costly to develop. Hibernate does the mapping for you.    Not only that, Hibernate makes it easy. Positioned as a layer between your application and your database, Hibernate takes care of loading and saving of objects. Hibernate applications are cheaper, more portable, and more resilient to change. And they perform better than anything you are likely to develop yourself.    Hibernate in Action carefully explains the concepts you need, then gets you going. It builds on a single example to show you how to use Hibernate in practice, how to deal with concurrency and transactions, how to efficiently retrieve objects and use caching.    The authors created Hibernate and they field questions from the Hibernate community every day - they know how to make Hibernate sing. Knowledge and insight seep out of every pore of this book.",

Hibernate, the most popular Java persistence tool, provides automatic and transparent object/relational mapping so it's a snap to work with SQL databases in Java applications. Hibernate conforms to the new EJB 3.0 and Java Persistence 1.0 standards.    Java Persistence with Hibernate explores Hibernate by developing an application that ties together hundreds of individual examples. You'll immediately dig into the rich programming model of Hibernate 3.2 and Java Persistence, working through queries, fetching strategies, caching, transactions, conversations, and more. You'll also appreciate the well-illustrated discussion of best practices in database design, object/relational mapping, and optimization techniques.    In this revised edition of Manning's bestselling Hibernate in Action, authors Christian Bauer and Gavin King -- the founder of the Hibernate project -- cover Hibernate 3.2 in detail along with the EJB 3.0 and Java Persistence 1.0 standards.",

Its native SDK offers a remarkable range of features including easy-to-build graphical objects, a unique navigation system, and a built-in database, all on a location-knowledgeable device. Websites and web apps can now behave like native iPhone apps, with great network integration.    iPhone in Action is an in-depth introduction to both native and web programming for the iPhone. You'll learn how to turn your web pages into compelling iPhone web apps using WebKit, iUI, and Canvas. The authors also take you step by step into more complex Objective-C programming. They help you master the iPhone SDK including its UI and features like accelerometers, GPS, the Address Book, SQLite, and many more. Using Apple's standard tools like Dashcode, Xcode, and Interface Builder, you'll learn how to best use both approaches: iPhone web and SDK programming.    This book is intended as an introduction to its topics. Proficiency with C, Cocoa, or Objective-C is helpful but not required.",

    "longDescription": "Microsoft describes Silverlight as a \"cross-browser, cross-platform plug-in for delivering the next generation of .NET based media experiences and rich interactive applications for the Web.\" That's a really boring description for a really exciting new technology. Anyone who has looked at the demos and gotten a taste of what Silverlight can do knows that Silverlight represents an entirely new level of rich web interface technology for Microsoft developers. With Silverlight 2, developers can use JavaScript, VB, C#, Python, and Ruby to build user-friendly, interactive, and visually-dazzling web applications that work in most major browsers.    Silverlight 2 in Action is the first book to cover Silverlight 2, a far more robust implementation of Silverlight than the current 1 release that supports only JavaScript. The much-anticipated 2 release adds powerful new features along with the ability to code in multiple languages and integrate your work with Visual Studio and the new Expression suite of tools. This book delivers real-world examples and in-depth walkthroughs to help you confidently enhance your web applications using Silverlight 2.    Silverlight 2 in Action devotes extensive coverage to flexible layout components, the extensible control model, the communication framework, and the data-binding features   all cornerstones of software development. Author and Microsoft MVP Chad Campbell also describes rich media and vivid graphical and animation features. The final chapters include a variety of Silverlight deployment scenarios.    In addition to the fundamentals of Silverlight, you'll be introduced to architectural components such as the Silverlight object model. The book addresses the developer/designer collaboration model Silverlight enables, showing the developer how to include the designer effectively in the project workflow. This model is illustrated throughout the examples.    For ongoing reader support, the author will maintain a dedicated book-support website providing up-to-the-minute working examples, complete with source code, all in Silverlight.",

Many computing tasks require taking data from one computer system, manipulating it in some way, and passing it to another. Munging can mean manipulating raw data to achieve a final form. It can mean parsing or filtering data, or the many steps required for data recognition. Or it can be something as simple as converting hours worked plus pay rates into a salary cheque.    This book shows you how to process data productively with Perl. It discusses general munging techniques and how to think about data munging problems. You will learn how to decouple the various stages of munging programs, how to design data structures, how to emulate the Unix filter model, etc. If you need to work with complex data formats it will teach you how to do that and also how to build your own tools to process these formats. The book includes detailed techniques for processing HTML and XML. And, it shows you how to build your own parsers to process data of arbitrary complexity.    If you are a programmer who munges data, this book will save you time. It will teach you systematic and powerful techniques using Perl.

    "shortDescription": "Seam in Action goes into great detail on the ways in which Seam helps reduce the burden of integration with different technologies such as Hibernate and JSF, allowing the developer to focus on the core business objective at hand.       Shobana Jayaraman, Digital Infrastructure Analyst, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Library, The Tech Static",
    "longDescription": "Seam is an exciting new application framework based on the Java EE platform that you can use to build rich, web-based business applications. Seam is rapidly capturing the interest of Java enterprise developers because of its focus on simplicity, ease of use, transparent integration, scalability, and developer choice.    Seam in Action offers a practical and in-depth look at Seam from outside the walls of RedHat/JBoss. The book puts Seam head-to-head with the complexities in the Java EE architecture. It discusses the shortcomings of JSF, the challenges of using Java persistence in the web environment, and other common development roadblocks, then shows how Seam makes these problems just melt away. In covering Seam, the author doesn't just ask you to sprinkle annotations on your code and expect that you understand how it works. Instead, the author lays down the facts, shows you the steps, reveals the logic, and diagrams the flow, so that by the end of the book, you will not only have gained a deep understanding of Seam, but will also come away ready to teach the material to others.    All too often, developers spend a majority of their time integrating disparate technologies, manually tracking state, struggling to understand JSF, wrestling with Hibernate exceptions, and constantly redeploying applications, rather than on the logic pertaining to the business at hand. Seam in Action dives deep into thorough explanations of how Seam eliminates these non-core tasks by leveraging configuration by exception, Java 5 annotations, and aspect-oriented programming.    To start off, you will see a working Java EE-compliant application come together by the end of the second chapter. As you progress through the book, you will discover how Seam eliminates unnecessary layers and configurations and uses an inversion of control technical known as bijection supplemented by a liberal use of the Unified Expression Language (EL) to establish the missing link between JSF, EJB 3 and JavaBean components. You also witness how Seam opens doors for you to incorporate technologies you previously have not had time to learn, such as business processes and stateful page flows (jBPM), rule-based security, Ajax remoting, PDF generation, Spring integration, and more.",

    "longDescription": "Service Oriented Architecture, or SOA, has become embraced by many organizations as a means of improving reusability of software assets; providing better alignment between business and IT; and, increasing agility for responding to demands in the marketplace. This is accomplished by breaking individual units of functionality into services that can then be exposed through open protocols and standards.    Until recently, many of the software technologies used for developing SOA-based solutions were limited to expensive, commercial offerings. However, that has now changed, and a compelling open source SOA platform can be implemented exclusively with open source products. This book identifies a suite of open source products that can be used for a building SOA environment, and describes how they can be integrated by practitioners. It includes a hands-on introduction to the products selected; a multitude of source code examples; and implementation through real-life case studies.",

    "longDescription": "If you are interested in Python and Tkinter, you have probably noticed that although there is some good contributed documentation on the Web, there is not enough to get Tkinter applications up and running. Python and Tkinter Programming is the answer. It is designed for readers who are familiar with Python and who need to develop applications with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).    Python and Tkinter Programming presents the elements of typical Python and Tkinter applications in a straight-forward fashion. Sample code illustrates each element. Complete applications that go far beyond the fill-the-form class of graphical user interfaces are presented; here you will find examples of complex controls, drawn interfaces and photorealistic panels. The code can readily be used as templates for new applications. Extensions to Python (such as ODBC) are examined as well. Complete source code for all examples, along with the latest releases of required software, will be available from Manning's web site.    Tkinter is fully documented. To date, this level of documentation has not been available to Tkinter programmers, who have been required to read the code or interpret Tcl/Tk man pages to fully understand component usage.    Python and Tkinter Programming will be useful in both Windows and Unix environments, and the example code is portable between the two environments.",

    "longDescription": "If you're a Java developer, you've almost certainly heard of OSGi   and also heard that it's becoming quite a big deal. But you may still be wondering exactly \"What is OSGi \"    Simply put, OSGi is a technology that allows you to create highly modular Java applications. It introduces a logical and physical module format, called a bundle, for explicitly structuring your application as a set of interconnected modules. OSGi lets you install, start, stop, update, or uninstall modules at execution time without taking down your entire system. In addition, OSGi defines a local service-oriented approach for creating applications out of loosely coupled components.    With the prevalence of modern component and service-based architectures, OSGi is becoming increasingly important. It meshes well with such approaches and greatly simplifies their creation and management. It's the backbone of Eclipse's plugin system as well as many recent JavaEE containers, such as GlassFish v3, WebSphere v6.1, and WebLogic Event Server. Even the SpringSource Application Platform is built on top of it.    OSGi in Action is a comprehensive guide to OSGi with two primary goals.    First, it provides a clear introduction to OSGi concepts with examples that are relevant both for architects and developers.

    "longDescription": "The Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is a new technology from Google that automatically translates Java into JavaScript, making Ajax applications easier to code and deploy. GWT in Action is a comprehensive tutorial for Java developers interested in building the next generation of rich, web-based applications. This book was written by Robert Hanson, creator of the popular GWT Widget Library, and Adam Tacy, a major contributor to the GWT Widget Library.    The Web is experiencing a new growth with an emphasis on rich, web-based applications. These applications can be difficult to build because they rely on JavaScript, which lacks the sophisticated object-oriented structures and static typing of Java, they are tricky to debug, and they require you to manage numerous browser inconsistencies.    In May of 2006 Google released the Google Web Toolkit. GWT enables developers to create Ajax applications in Java. With GWT, you can build your applications using a real object-oriented language and take advantage of Java tools like Eclipse that are already available. Instead of trying to bring tool support to Ajax, Google brought Ajax to a place where the tools already existed.    GWT in Action shows you how to take advantage of these exciting new tools. This clearly-written book is packed with hands-on GWT examples. You   ll absorb the GWT philosophy as you build your first working GWT application.    The book begins by exploring the main features of GWT, including    Compiling Java to JavaScript, the magic that really defines GWT  Building client-side components  Convenient JUnit integration and testing  Interacting with JavaScript and existing JavaScript libraries  Internationalization  You   ll also see how GWT compares to other toolkits.    GWT in Action shows you how to set up your development environment, use and create widgets, communicate with the server, and much more. Readers will follow an example running throughout the book and quickly master the basics of GWT: widgets, panels, and event handling. The book covers the full development cycle, from setting up your development environment, to building the application, then deploying it to the web server. The entire core GWT library is discussed, with details and examples on how it can be extended.    You   ll cover:    Testing, debugging, and deploying GWT Applications  Communicating with GWT-RPC  Examining client-side RPC architecture  Alternative RPC tools: HTTPRequest, RequestBuilder, and FormPanel  Achieving interoperability in GWT with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  Making your GWT application flexible and supportable  GWT helps you make the most of Ajax in your web applications and GWT in Action helps you get more out of GWT.",

    "longDescription": "As organizations try to do more with less, development teams are less likely to be centrally located, tightly-managed, and permanent. Distributed organizations face special challenges when implementing Agile processes, which rely on frequent communication and responsive teams. Distributed Agile in Action is a guide to running successful Agile projects within geographically and culturally diverse organizations.    Distributed Agile in Action is the first book to directly address the unique task of going Agile in a distributed team. Rather than rehashing Agile theories, this book supplies the practical examples and step by step advice you need to help your distributed teams adopt and embrace Agile principles. It's a distilled and carefully organized learning aid for working in a distributed Agile environment, with in-depth focus on how to approach three critical components of development-People, Process and Technology.    It's jam-packed with suggestions and stories gained from the authors' distributed Agile journey working with teams spread across cultures, continents, and time zones. The book includes a complete case study presenting an increasingly-common project scenario.    This book is written for developers and project managers in distributed teams. Although the examples and case study are presented in Java / Java EE, best practices from rest of the book are technology agnostic and would work equally well for any environment.",

    "longDescription": "Due to the growing complexity of web sites, portals and portlets are experiencing serious growth. Portals help reduce complexity by allowing the dynamic aggregation and display of diverse content in a single web page. Portal components are pluggable parts called portlets. To be \"pluggable\" portlets and portals must satisfy standards. The authors of this book, all but one employees of IBM, created these standards: Java Portlet Specification JSR 168 and Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP).    The book starts gently with the basics of portlet technology and a functionrich portlet example. It then dives more deeply into portlets and J2EE, portlet architecture, best practices, and explores how the popular JSF web framework can ease portlet development. It shows how to set up an open source portal and create portlets that dynamically access backend data of various types. It is rich in something readers want: code examples that show them how to do it.",

The book includes step-by-step instruction for building dozens of code generators of varying types. These generators build high-quality output that is consistent and maintainable. Code generation abstracts the design of the code so that multiple outputs can be created from a single model of the application functionality, which means development teams can focus on higher-level design work and strategic problems, while still meeting goals for maintaining production applications.. The book covers techniques that range from simple code processors that handle common coding problems to more elaborate and complex generators that maintain entire application tiers.  Code Generation In Action covers building database access, user interface, remote procedure, test cases, and business logic code as well as code for other key system functions.    Although code generation is an engineering technique it also has a large impact on the engineering team and management. The book discusses the non-technical justifications for code generation in depth, and offers practical advice for making code generation succeed in any organization.",

    "shortDescription": "Many software projects fail unnecessarily because of unclear objectives, redundant and unproductive work, cost overruns, and a host of other avoidable process problems. In response, agile processes and lightweight tooling have begun to replace traditional engineering processes throughout the development lifecycle. An agile approach to application lifecycle management improves product quality, reduces time to market, and makes for happier developers.    Agile ALM is a guide for Java developers who want to integrate flexible agile practices and lightweight tooling along all phases of the software development process. The book introduces a new vision for managing change in requirements and process more efficiently and flexibly. You'll learn powerful practices like task-based Development, where you align activities into tasks resulting in traceable artifacts, Continuous Integration, in which you frequently and systematically integrate, build, and test an application in development and using Scrum as an agile approach to release management. The effect is a more comprehensive and practical approach to build, configuration, deployment, release, test, quality, integration, and requirements management.    This book synthesizes technical and functional elements to provide a comprehensive approach to software development. You'll learn to see the whole scope of the development process as a set of defined tasks, many of which are repeated daily, and then master the tools and practices you need to accomplish each of those tasks efficiently.    Because efficient tool chains can radically improve the speed and fluidity of the development process, this book demonstrates how to integrate state-of-the-art lightweight tools. Many of the tools and examples are Java-based, but the Agile ALM principles apply to all development platforms. As well, the many examples show how you can bridge different languages and systems.",

    "longDescription": "Statistical data is only as valuable as your ability to analyze, interpret, and present it in a meaningful way. Gnuplot is the most widely used program to plot and visualize data for Unix/Linux systems and it is also popular for Windows and the Mac. It's open-source (as in free!), actively maintained, stable, and mature. It can deal with arbitrarily large data sets and is capable of producing high-quality, publication-ready graphics.    So far, the only comprehensive documentation available about gnuplot is the online reference documentation, which makes it both hard to get started and almost impossible to get a complete overview over all of its features. If you've never tried gnuplot   or have found it tough to get your arms around   read on.    Gnuplot in Action is the first comprehensive introduction to gnuplot   from the basics to the power features and beyond. Besides providing a tutorial on gnuplot itself, it demonstrates how to apply and use gnuplot to extract intelligence from data. Particular attention is paid to tricky or poorly-explained areas. You will learn how to apply gnuplot to actual data analysis problems. This book looks at different types of graphs that can be generated with gnuplot and will discuss when and how to use them to extract actual information from data.    One of gnuplot's main advantages is that it requires no programming skills nor knowledge of advanced mathematical or statistical concepts. Gnuplot in Action assumes you have no previous knowledge of either gnuplot or statistics and data analysis. The books starts out with basic gnuplot concepts, then describes in depth how to get a graph ready for final presentation and to make it look \"just right\" by including arrows, labels, and other decorations.    Next the book looks at advanced concepts, such as multi-dimensional graphs and false-color plots   powerful features for special purposes. The author also describes advanced applications of gnuplot, such as how to script gnuplot so that it can run unattended as a batch job, and how to call gnuplot from within a CGI script to generate graphics for dynamic websites on demand.    Gnuplot in Action makes gnuplot easy for anyone who needs to do data analysis, but doesn't have an education in analytical tools and methods. It's perfect for DBAs, programmers, and performance engineers; business analysts and MBAs; and Six-Sigma Black Belts and process engineers.",

Until now.    Elements of Programming with Perl is a general introduction to programming, using Perl as the implementation language. It starts at the beginning, teaching programming style, structure, and design. It covers all the fundamental elements of Perl (e.g., pattern matching and text processing) and proceeds to advanced concepts, including modular programming, abstract data structures, and object oriented programming.    Elements of Programming with Perl contains numerous examples and diagrams that illustrate concepts, algorithms and techniques. Complete example programs show the new programmer how to tie concepts together to solve real-world problems.

    "longDescription": "In Windows, there's a control panel, dialog box, administrative console, API, or wizard to manage every component of your system. There are    thousands    of them   so many that it can be nearly impossible to keep track of all the locations and settings you need to administer Windows effectively. For administrators, PowerShell is a godsend because it provides a single, unified command line from which you can control and automate every aspect of Windows. PowerShell finally enables Windows administrators to work in a way that Unix and Linux administrators have leveraged for decades.    Like classic administrative shells, PowerShell accepts and immediately executes typed commands. In addition, it has all the features of a full-fledged programming language built in, so you can create scripts to automate even the most complex tasks. And it's fully aware of all the components of Windows and most Windows servers, so you can use PowerShell to control Exchange, IIS, SharePoint, and other core pieces of your Windows system.

Getting started on a project is proving to be a huge challenge to practitioners. This book seeks to change that. It provides a bottom-up understanding of security techniques appropriate for use in SOA without assuming any prior familiarity with security topics.    Unlike most other books about SOA that merely describe the standards, this book helps readers learn through action, by walking them through sample code that illustrates how real life problems can be solved using the techniques and best practices described in the standards. It simplifies things: where standards usually discuss many possible variations of each security technique, this book focuses on the 20% of variations that are used 80% of the time. This keeps the material covered useful for all readers except the most advanced.",

    "longDescription": "In December 2008, the Merb team announced that they will be collaborating with the Rails core team on the next versions of Merb and Rails. Rather than maintaining parallel tracks, Merb 2 and Rails 3 will merge, preserving the flexible configuration and advanced features that Merb users love along with the rapid productivity and ease-of-use that makes Rails shine. As Engine Yard developer (and Manning author) Yehuda Katz puts it, \"Effectively, Merb 2 is Rails 3.\"    Rails 3 in Action will provide a thorough introduction to Ruby-based web development using Rails. Like Rails 3 itself, this book combines Merb and Rails in the form of authors Yehuda Katz, Merb Lead Developer.    As a developer, you'll benefit from several big advantages to this change:  Rails becomes more modular, by building on rails core with the ability to opt in or out of specific components and making it possible to replace parts of Rails without disturbing other parts.  Merb performance improvements flow into Rails, including benchmarking applications so developers can see which optimizations have real-world impact.  A defined public API with a test suite, so users and plugin developers have a stable API to build against.  A \"core\" version of Rails, like Merb's current core generator, that makes it easy to select just the parts that are important for your app.  DataMapper and Sequel support as first-class ORMs, along with ActiveRecord as the default.  Rack support in Rails 3, to improve the state of modular, sharable logic between applications.  The Rails 3 team is moving full steam ahead building the new version. The Merb team will start working on Rails immediately, and also continue to fix bugs and resolve other major issues in the current release of Merb. Interim versions of Merb will help ease the transition to Rails 3. In particular, Merb releases with deprecation notices and other transitional mechanisms will assist developers in tracking down the changes between Merb 1.x and Rails 3.    If you've already learned Merb, Rails 3 in Action will help you parlay that knowledge into the new Rails code base. If you're a long time Rails developer, it will help you get up to speed with all the new Rails 3 features and changes.",

The three-year-old requirements doc is totally irrelevant. The boss wants to ship, ship, ship. The team in Austin has no idea what the team in Arlington is up to. You are in integration hell. Ready to try something different     Continuous integration is a software engineering process designed to minimize \"integration hell.\" It's a coordinated development approach that blends the best practices in software delivery: frequent integration, constant readiness, short build feedback cycles, persistent testing, and a flexible approach to developing--and modifying--system requirements. For .NET developers, especially, adopting these new approaches and the tools that support can require rethinking your dev process altogether.    Continuous Integration in .NET is a tutorial for developers and team leads that teaches you to reimagine your development strategy by creating a consistent continuous integration process. This book shows you how to build on the tools you already know--.NET Framework and Visual Studio and to use powerful software like MSBuild, Subversion, TFS 2010, Team City, CruiseControl.NET, NUnit, and Selenium.    Because CI is as much about the culture of your shop as the tooling, this book will help you bridge resistance to adoption by providing clear guidelines for starting and maintaining projects-along with defined metrics for measuring project success. Each author brings a unique set of experiences and practices to create a rich and varied picture of this powerful technique.

    "longDescription": "An engine of the world economy, the computer industry is sputtering. What happened  Will it regain its power and again drive economic growth as in the past     No.    That's the surprising conclusion reached by Erik Keller, a central player in the booming IT world of the 1990s. Driven by fear of being left behind, American corporations let IT grow until it reached one half of all corporate capital spending by the year 2000. Now, chastened by their spending failures, IT managers are converging on a new consensus: to exploit IT competitively they must use their smarts over big money.    This shift in thinking comes just as free, open-source software, low-cost international programming labor, and new technologies combine to make the new approach possible.    A former Research Fellow at Gartner, Keller had an insider's view of the irrational spending at many Fortune 500 companies, personally influencing billions of dollars of technology acquisitions.    In Technology Paradise Lost Keller describes how the new thinking is working inside some of the country's most complex and successful organizations, including Merrill Lynch, JetBlue, Harrah's, and Motorola which have cut IT spending to gain a competitive edge, and experienced marked gains to their bottom lines.    As it advances, the new IT think will cause further massive disruptions in the computer business, with fundamental changes in the ways software is developed, sold, and used. Efficiency of IT investment will grow as excess fat is squeezed out of IT salaries, software system costs, and consultants' fees.    In an unexpected twist, Keller argues that even as IT spending is reduced its importance for competitiveness will grow. Reduced spending does not mean IT has become a commodity. Counterintuitively, companies that spend less in order to get more from information technology will likely be the big winners.",

    "longDescription": "Laszlo in Action is the first comprehensive guide to the Laszlo system and its language LZX. OpenLaszlo is an increasingly popular open-source platform for the development and delivery of rich internet applications across multiple platforms: Flash, DHTML, and J2ME. The dramatic emergence of Ajax over the past year was a first step in the transition from page-oriented HTML web applications towards more full-featured rich internet applications. OpenLaszlo provides another important step in this continuing evolutionary process through the increased productivity resulting from LZX's declarative approach. It provides developers with the tools to create web-based applications offering the usability and interactivity associated with desktop applications, and the low costs associated with web-based deployment. The cross-platform nature of Laszlo LZX applications allows source code with only minimum modifications to run natively on all popular web browsers, on all desktop operating systems, on the Flash platform, and other platforms in the future.    Written to address the needs of a wide spectrum of developers, ranging from client-side HTML and JavaScript developers all the way to enterprise-class Java or Rails engineers, this book provides a very hands-on approach towards building applications that solve real-world problems across both the Flash and DHTML platforms. Starting with the fundamentals of Laszlo LZX, the authors quickly move towards applying this knowledge to the design and development of a full-scale application called the Laszlo Market. This provides a working context to assist understanding the underlying concepts of Laszlo LZX and, more importantly, how to apply this knowledge in innovative ways. The construction of the Laszlo Market proceeds over the course of the book illustrating topics starting with an initial wireframe and storyboard design to optimization issues dealing with the application's deployment across the Flash and DHTML platforms.",

As NHibernate is a port of Hibernate from Java to .NET, the book is based on Manning's bestselling Hibernate in Action.    NHibernate in Action begins by describing how to implement persistence in a layered .NET application. The book then quickly springs into action by introducing NHibernate through a classic \"Hello World\" example. It explains how to configure NHibernate to specify the mapping information between business objects and database tables, and then explores the internal architecture of NHibernate. A complete example application is progressively built with Agile methodologies in mind, which shows readers all kinds of entity and relationship mappings and how to perform CRUD operations. The book also covers advanced techniques like caching, concurrency access, and isolation levels. The Hibernate Query Language (HQL) and criteria query APIs are thoroughly detailed with optimization tips.    The last chapters of this book discuss various development scenarios, how to implement the layers of an NHibernate application (covering Windows and Web development), and which tools are available for these tasks. They also provide some solutions for data-binding objects to .NET GUI controls, integrating services, and interacting with components using DataSets. Finally, they explain how to build a complex application involving advanced session management and distributed transactions.",

    "longDescription": "A software system is the realization of a set of concerns. One of the central premises of object-oriented programming is that each concern should be implemented as a separate module. However, there are certain system-wide concerns, such as logging, security, performance, and so forth, that often need to be addressed in many, if not all of the modules. Consequently, the code to handle these system-wide concerns may be mixed in with the core logic of a huge number of modules, resulting in lower productivity, poor quality, and systems that are hard to evolve.    Aspect-oriented programming overcomes these problems by modularizing the system-wide concerns.    AspectJ enables AOP programming in Java by adding a few new language constructs. By using Java as the base language and creating a final system that is compatible with Java byte code specification, AspectJ passes on all the benefits of Java. The use of Java as the base language also makes AspectJ a relatively easy language to learn.    AspectJ in Action is a practical guide to AOP and AspectJ. The reusable code examples that are provided will enable quick implementation of functionality in your system.    The book is divided into three parts. The first part introduces AOP and AspectJ and will be helpful to developers wanting to learn or advance their knowledge of AspectJ. The second and third parts present examples of everyday situations in which you can use simple and easy AspectJ solutions to implement common system requirements such as logging, policy enforcement, resource pooling, business rules, thread-safety, authentication and authorization, as well as transaction management.",

    "longDescription": "Hadoop is an open source framework implementing the MapReduce algorithm behind Google's approach to querying the distributed data sets that constitute the internet. This definition naturally leads to an obvious question, \"What are \"maps\" and why do they need to be \"reduced \"    Massive data sets can be extremely difficult to analyze and query using traditional mechanisms, especially when the queries themselves are quite complicated. In effect, the MapReduce algorithm breaks up both the query and the data set into constituent parts   that's the \"mapping.\" The mapped components of the query can be processed simultaneously   or \"reduced\"   to rapidly return results.    Hadoop in Action teaches readers how to use Hadoop and write MapReduce programs. The intended readers are programmers, architects, and project managers who have to process large amounts of data offline. Hadoop in Action will lead the reader from obtaining a copy of Hadoop to setting it up in a cluster and writing data analytic programs.    The book begins by making the basic idea of Hadoop and MapReduce easier to grasp by applying the default Hadoop installation to a few easy-to-follow tasks, such as analyzing changes in word frequency across a body of documents. The book continues through the basic concepts of MapReduce applications developed using Hadoop, including a close look at framework components, use of Hadoop for a variety of data analysis tasks, and numerous examples of Hadoop in action.    Hadoop in Action will explain how to use Hadoop and present design patterns and practices of programming MapReduce. MapReduce is a complex idea both conceptually and in its implementation, and Hadoop users are challenged to learn all the knobs and levers for running Hadoop. This book takes you beyond the mechanics of running Hadoop, teaching you to write meaningful programs in a MapReduce framework.    This book assumes the reader will have a basic familiarity with Java, as most code examples will be written in Java. Familiarity with basic statistical concepts (e.g. histogram, correlation) will help the reader appreciate the more advanced data processing examples.",

Its usefulness as a guide to deeper understanding of business computing will be appreciated by professionals and managers at all levels. This book covers a rich collection of topics, each explained, interrelated, and placed in a coherent framework so that its importance and likely evolution are clear. The author does not shy away from stating his views; he provides color, insight and humor.    Doing IT Right is a tour de force based on Lorin's prodigious knowledge of the industry derived from years of involvement with development and marketing at IBM and other systems houses and from consulting in a variety of environments. It also has its roots in a great many publications of the author, from trade and journal articles and book chapters to six earlier books.    Doing IT Right explores IT in its full complexity. It explains fundamental issues of hardware and software structures; it illuminates central issues of networking and encapsulates the essence of client/server computing; its coverage of costing, risk assessment, and due diligence in making computing decisions is unique; its presentation of the concepts and issues of object-orientation was considered by the managers at an IBM development laboratory to be Unique and more informative than fifteen other OO presentations put together.",

    "longDescription": "Whether you're writing a desktop app, spinning up a rich web interface, or pushing code to a mobile phone, graphics programming should be easier, and more fun, than it currently is. New technologies and devices   not to mention higher user expectations   have greatly multiplied the complexity level of interface programming. Enter JavaFX.    JavaFX is a set of Java-based rich user interface technologies that sits atop the existing Java Standard and Micro Editions, making current Java packages readily accessible from the JavaFX environment. At its heart is JavaFX Script, an innovative, compiled, domain specific language. JavaFX Script boasts a declarative syntax where the code structure mirrors the structure of the interface. Related UI pieces are kept in one efficient bundle, not strewn across multiple locations. A simple coding model reduces code complexity while increasing productivity. The JavaFX-specific libraries for presentation and animation take advantage of JavaFX Script's unique language features.    JavaFX in Action is a hands-on tutorial that introduces and explores JavaFX through numerous bite-sized projects. The book provides a solid grounding in the JavaFX syntax and related APIs by showing you how to apply the key features of the JavaFX platform. You'll absorb the fundamentals of the technology while exploring the possibilities JavaFX open up for your designs.    Author Simon Morris helps you transform variables and operators into bouncing raindrops, brilliant colors, and dancing interface components. Below the chrome, you'll master techniques to make your applications more responsive and user friendly. You'll also learn how to interact with your existing Java code so you can give your old apps some new JavaFX sparkle.",

    "longDescription": "Cascading Style Sheets paint the web as the user sees it, and for fifteen years, we've been painting the web by hand. Sass and Compass extend standard CSS to give you more flexibility and the option to simplify or automate many tedious tasks. Think of Sass and Compass as power tools that allow stylesheet authors to \"paint\" with remarkable speed and precision.    Sass is an extension of CSS3, adding language features for creating well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin. Compass is a framework that sits atop Sass and tackles common stylesheet problems such as grid layouts, handling CSS3 vendor differences, and production environment stylesheet optimization. Together, they do for CSS what jQuery has done for JavaScript: solve real world problems, letting designers and developers create stylesheets more efficiently.    Sass and Compass in Action is the definitive guide to stylesheet authoring using these two revolutionary tools.

Authors Wynn Netherland, Nathan Weizenbaum, and Chris Eppstein cover prominent community plugins that allows stylesheet authors to share styles as developers of other programming languages such as Ruby, Python, Java, and, .NET do. The book also presents Sass and Compass case studies using hot technologies like Sencha Touch. The book culminates in a step-by-step look at building a personal stylesheet framework in which readers can bundle their own approaches and opinions and reuse them across projects.",

    "longDescription": "A successful ASP.NET application needs to accomplish its functional goals, provide a comfortable user experience, and be easy to deploy, maintain, and extend. ASP.NET MVC is a development framework designed around these principles. It provides the structure you need to follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, in which an application is divided into three distinct parts:        * Models, the objects that contain an application's logic      * Views, the components that create the user interface of an application      * Controllers, the components that handle and respond to user input    Applications built with ASP.NET MVC are easier to test, maintain, and extend because the architecture and role of each component is well-defined. And since it's built from the ground up as a core part of the .NET framework, it integrates seamlessly with the ASP.NET features, such as Web Forms or Master Pages, that you already use.    ASP.NET MVC 3 in Action is a fast-paced tutorial designed to introduce ASP.NET MVC to .NET developers and show how to apply it effectively. After a high-speed ramp up, the book explores key topics like validation, routing, and data access.

The book bases all its examples on ASP.NET MVC 3, so you'll get full coverage of major new features such as the Razor view engine, the new Web Matrix helpers, and improved extensibility. MVC 3 is also the first version built exclusively against .NET 4, so you'll see how your ASP.NET applications can benefit from changes in the .NET Framework.",

    "longDescription": "It's been said that data is the new \"dirt\"   the raw material from which and on which you build the structures of the modern world. And like dirt, data can seem like a limitless, undifferentiated mass. The ability to take raw data, access it, filter it, process it, visualize it, understand it, and communicate it to others is possibly the most essential business problem for the coming decades.    \"Machine learning,\" the process of automating tasks once considered the domain of highly-trained analysts and mathematicians, is the key to efficiently extracting useful information from this sea of raw data. By implementing the core algorithms of statistical data processing, data analysis, and data visualization as reusable computer code, you can scale your capacity for data analysis well beyond the capabilities of individual knowledge workers.    Machine Learning in Action is a unique book that blends the foundational theories of machine learning with the practical realities of building tools for everyday data analysis. In it, you'll use the flexible Python programming language to build programs that implement algorithms for data classification, forecasting, recommendations, and higher-level features like summarization and simplification.    As you work through the numerous examples, you'll explore key topics like classification, numeric prediction, and clustering. Along the way, you'll be introduced to important established algorithms, such as Apriori, through which you identify association patterns in large datasets and Adaboost, a meta-algorithm that can increase the efficiency of many machine learning tasks.",

A CRM application must know about the order history of a customer, but that history is stored in the sales application. A technology that companies increasingly use to integrate enterprise applications is the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).    Open-Source ESBs in Action describes how to use ESBs in real-world situations. You will learn how the various features of an ESB such as transformation, routing, security, connectivity, and more can be implemented on the example of two open-source ESB implementations: Mule and ServiceMix. The authors first introduce ServiceMix and Mule, and then present general principles and patterns of ESB use, as well as a structured approach to solving common integration problems, through examples using them.    Working in integration projects is exciting, with new technologies and paradigms arriving every day. In this area, open source is playing a more and more dominant role with projects such as Mule and ServiceMix. Open-Source ESBs in Action will help you to learn open-source integration technologies quickly and will provide you with knowledge that you can use to effectively work with Mule and ServiceMix.",

Because they are often large and complex, GUI programming toolkits can be hard to use. wxPython is a combination of the Python programming language and the wxWidgets toolkit, which allows programmers to create programs with a robust, highly functional graphical user interface, simply and easily. wxPython combines the power of an exceptionally complete user interface toolkit with an exceptionally flexible programming language. The result is a toolkit that is unique in the ease with which complex applications can be built and maintained.    wxPython in Action is a complete guide to the wxPython toolkit, containing a tutorial for getting started, a guide to best practices, and a reference to wxPython s extensive widget set. After an easy introduction to wxPython concepts and programming practices, the book takes an in-depth tour of when and how to use the bountiful collection of widgets offered by wxPython. All features are illustrated with useful code examples and reference tables are included for handy lookup of an object s properties, methods, and events. The book enables developers to learn wxPython quickly and remains a valuable resource for future work.",

OOram has been fine-tuned over a decade on hundreds of projects by Trygve Reenskaug and his collaborators. It is supported by available CASE tools, training, and consulting.    Working With Objects is the source on a method which takes an evolutionary step forward in object-oriented development practices. OOram adds the intuitively simple but powerful concept of a role to object-oriented models and methods. For example, imagine trying to describe a person as an object. The most effective way to do this would be to independently describe each of the roles that person adopts (parent, employee, and so on) and then define how the person supports them. These ideas form the heart of the OOram approach.    In a presentation rich with examples, Working With Objects is anything but the typical, dry methodology book. It tells real-life stories. It teaches how to apply role modeling and benefit from its inherent advantages, including:    Multiple views of the same model  Support for both data- and process-centered approaches  Large systems described through a number of distinct models  Derivation of composite models from simpler, base models  Decentralized management of very large systems  Programming language-independent design  Step-by-step transformation of models into implementations  Integration of powerful reuse techniques with work policies, processes and organization",

    "longDescription": "SOA   Service Oriented Architecture   has become the leading solution for complex, connected business systems. While it's easy to grasp the theory of SOA, implementing well-designed, practical SOA systems can be a difficult challenge. Developers and enterprise architects still face the following issues:        * How to get high-availability with SOA      * How to know a service has failed      * How to create reports when data is scattered within multiple services      * How to increase the loose coupling of your SOA      * How to solve authentication and authorization for service consumers--internal and external      * How to integrate SOA and the UI      * How to avoid common SOA pitfalls      * How to choose technologies that increase the performance of your services    In SOA Patterns, author Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz provides detailed, technology-neutral solutions to these challenges, and many others. This book provides architectural guidance through patterns and anti-patterns. It shows you how to build real SOA services that feature flexibility, availability, and scalability. Through an extensive set of patterns, this book identifies the major SOA pressure points and provides reusable techniques to address them. Each pattern pairs the classic Problem/Solution format with a unique technology map, showing where specific solutions fit into the general pattern.    SOA Patterns shows you how to address common SOA concerns, including the areas of performance, availability, scalability, security, management, service interaction, user interface interaction, and service aggregation. The SOA anti-patterns part shows you how to avoid common mistakes and how to refactor broken systems. The book also maps quality attributes to patterns so that you can easily find the patterns relevant to your problems.    WHAT'S INSIDE:        * Details more than 30 patterns for common SOA scenarios in the areas of security, performace, availability, UI integration, service aggregation and service interaction      * Describes more than 20 SOA pitfalls to avoid      * Spotlights the architecural perspective on SOA      * Explains technology mapping from conceptual solution to current technologies      * Provides extensive and practical advice on matching patterns to technologies  ",

    "longDescription": "Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design technique emphasizing Separation of Concerns, Modularity, Extensibility and Testability. Applied well, it enables programmers to successfully deal with complexity in software and add new features to existing apps with greater ease. DI is the key to writing modular software and producing flexible and maintainable code bases.    While well-known among Java developers and other practitioners of object-oriented design, DI is only now gaining momentum in the .NET community. The Unity container released by Microsoft patterns & practices and the new Microsoft Extensibility Framework (MEF) make DI more relevant than ever for .NET developers.    Dependency Injection in .NET is a comprehensive guide than introduces DI and provides an in-depth look at applying DI practices to .NET apps. In it, you will also learn to integrate DI together with such technologies as Windows Communication Foundation, ASP.NET MVC, Windows Presentation Foundation and other core .NET components.    Building on your existing knowledge of C# and the .NET platform, this book will be most beneficial for readers who have already built at least a few software solutions of intermediate complexity. Most examples are in plain C# without use of any particular DI framework. Later, the book introduces several well-known DI frameworks, such as StructureMap, Windsor and Spring.NET. For each framework, it presents examples of its particular usage, as well as examines how the framework relates to the common patterns presented earlier in the book.

Eric Siber, Developpez.com",
    "longDescription": "Agile principles have been a breath of fresh air to many development teams stuck in the middle of a rigid, process-driven environment. Unfortunately, it's not so easy to bring Agile into an existing organization with established people and practices. Becoming Agile shows you practical techniques and strategies to move from your existing process to an Agile process without starting from scratch.    Many books discuss Agile from a theoretical or academic perspective. Becoming Agile takes a different approach and focuses on explaining Agile from a ground-level point-of-view. Author Greg Smith, a certified ScrumMaster with dozens of Agile projects under his belt, presents Agile principles in the context of a case study that flows throughout the book.    Becoming Agile focuses on the importance of adapting Agile principles to the realities of your environment. While Agile purists have often discouraged a    partial-Agile    approach, the reality is that in many shops a    purist    approach simply isn't a viable option. Over the last few years, Agile authorities have begun to discover that the best deployments of Agile are often customized to the specific situation of a given company.  As well, Becoming Agile addresses the cultural realities of deploying Agile and how to deal with the needs of executives, managers, and the development team during migration. The author discusses employee motivation and establishing incentives that reward support of Agile techniques.    Becoming Agile will show you how to create a custom Agile process that supports the realities of your environment. The process will minimize risk as you transition to Agile iteratively, allowing time for your culture and processes to acclimate to Agile principles.",

    "longDescription": "Modern distributed architectures require a secure, reliable way to exchange messages in asynchronous, loosely-coupled systems. For Java developers, the Java Message Service (JMS) provides that core functionality. The Apache ActiveMQ message broker is a complete open source implementation of the JMS specification. The ActiveMQ Message-Oriented Middleware, coupled with its Enterprise Integration Provider are the building blocks of an Enterprise Service Bus   the backbone of a contemporary Service Oriented Architecture.    ActiveMQ is implemented in Java, but it supports client applications written in many other programming languages including C/C++, .NET, Ruby, Perl, PHP, Python, and more. It can be integrated with other open source frameworks including Tomcat, ServiceMix, JBoss, and can easily bridge to other JMS providers.    Apache ActiveMQ in Action is a thorough, practical guide to implementing message-oriented systems in Java using ActiveMQ. The book lays out the core of ActiveMQ in clear language, starting with the anatomy of a JMS message and moving quickly through connectors, message persistence, authentication and authorization. With the basics well in hand, you move into interesting examples of ActiveMQ at work, following a running Stock Portfolio application. You'll integrate ActiveMQ with containers like Geronimo and JBoss and learn to tie into popular Java-based technologies like Spring Framework.    Along the way, you'll pick up best practices forged out of the deep experience the authors bring to the book. You'll learn to integrate with non-Java technologies and explore advanced topics like broker topologies and configuration and performance tuning.    Additionally, the book will introduce readers to using Apache Camel with Apache ActiveMQ as a way to easily utilize the Enterprise Integration Patterns.",

    "longDescription": "For enterprise Java developers, Spring Framework provides remarkable improvements in developer productivity, runtime performance, and overall application quality. Its unique blend of a complete, lightweight container that allows you to build a complex application from loosely-coupled POJOs and a set of easily understood abstractions that simplify construction, testing, and deployment make Spring both powerful and easy-to-use   a hard-to-beat combination. With this power comes the potential for a wide range of uses in both common and not-so-common scenarios. That's where Spring in Practice comes in.    Unlike the many books that teach you what Spring is, Spring in Practice shows you how to tackle the challenges you face when you build Spring-based applications. The book empowers software developers to solve concrete business problems \"the Spring way\" by mapping application-level issues to Spring-centric solutions.    Spring in Practice diverges from other cookbooks because it presents the background you need to understand the domain in which a solution applies before it offers the specific steps to solve the problem. You're never left with the feeling that you understand the answer, but find the question irrelevant. You can put the book to immediate use even if you don't have deep knowledge of every part of Spring Framework.    The book divides into three main parts. In Part 1, you'll get a rapid overview of Spring Framework   enough to get you started if you're new and a great refresher for readers who already have a few Spring cycles. Part 2 provides techniques that are likely to be useful no matter what type of application you're building. You'll find discussions of topics like user accounts, security, site navigation, and application diagnosis.    Part 3 provides domain-specific recipes. Here, you'll find practical solutions to realistic and interesting business problems. For example, this part discusses Spring-based approaches for ecommerce, lead generation, and CRM.    There are several recurring themes throughout Spring in Practice, including Spring MVC, Hibernate, and transactions. Each recipe is an opportunity to highlight something new or interesting about Spring, and to focus on that concept in detail.    This book assumes you have a good foundation in Java and Java EE. Prior exposure to Spring Framework is helpful, but not required.",

Multiple processors with multiple cores running multiple threads is quickly becoming the norm. C++ developers will have to master the principles, techniques, and new language features supporting concurrency to stay ahead of the curve.    With the new C++ Standard and Technical Report 2 (TR2), multi-threading is coming to C++ in a big way. There is a new memory model with support for multiple threads, along with a new multi-threading support library featuring low-level atomic operations, as well as basic thread launching and synchronization facilities. TR2 will provide higher-level synchronization facilities that allow for a much greater level of abstraction, and make programming multi-threaded applications simpler and safer.    C++ Concurrency in Action is the first book to show you how to take advantage of the new C++ Standard and TR2 to write robust multi-threaded applications in C++.

If you're a programmer accustomed to writing single-threaded applications, C++ Concurrency in Action will show you how to write your new parallel algorithm in C++. You'll learn to avoid many of the pitfalls associated with writing multi-threaded applications.

    "longDescription": "Whether you want to build an autonomous robot, automate your home electronics, or just automatically tweet when the bread is ready, you can do it with Arduino. Arduino is an inexpensive, easy-to-use, open source hardware and software platform. It supports a mind-boggling array of sensors and components that you can use to build nearly anything you can imagine.\n\nArduino in Action is a hands-on guide to prototyping and building electronics using the Arduino platform. Suitable for beginners and advanced users, this easy to follow book begins with the basics and systematically guides you through projects ranging from your first blinking LED through connecting Arduino to devices like game controllers or your iPhone.\n\nYou'll start at the very beginning: unpacking your first Arduino board, connecting it to a PC, and using the programming environment to make something happen. You'll follow progressively more complex examples as you connect your Arduino to motors, LCD displays, Wi-Fi, GPS, and Bluetooth. You'll explore a variety of input output sensors, including ultrasound, infrared, and light, along with how to use them for tasks like robotic obstacle avoidance.",

    "shortDescription": "Node.js in Action is an example-driven tutorial that starts at square one and guides you through all the features, techniques, and concepts you'll need to build production-quality Node applications. You'll start by learning how to set up your Node development environment, including loading the community-created extensions. Next, you'll run several simple demonstration programs where you'll learn the basics of a few common types of Node applications. Then you'll dive into asynchronous programming, a model Node leverages to lessen application bottlenecks.",
    "longDescription": "JavaScript on the server? Yep. Node.js is an elegant server-side JavaScript development environment perfect for scalable, high-performance web applications. With Node you access HTTP and TCP/IP functionality through a minimalist server-side Javascript interface. It supports an asynchronous programming model that enables the web server to more easily do more than one thing at a time, a key requirement for real-time applications such as chat, online games, and live statistics. And since it's JavaScript, you'll use the same language throughout your entire application.\n\nNode.js in Action is an example-driven tutorial that starts at square one and guides you through all the features, techniques, and concepts you'll need to build production-quality Node applications. You'll start by learning how to set up your Node development environment, including loading the community-created extensions. Next, you'll run several simple demonstration programs where you'll learn the basics of a few common types of Node applications. Then you'll dive into asynchronous programming, a model Node leverages to lessen application bottlenecks.\n\nWith the basics under your belt, you're ready to start building serious web applications using Node's HTTP API. You'll explore data storage, application deployment, and output templating, and you'll discover community frameworks that make web development easier and faster. Along the way, you'll learn to interact with the filesystem and to create non-HTTP applications, such as TCP/IP servers and command-line tools.\n\nMuch of the Node ecosystem is open source, so this book will show you how the community works and how you can contribute. You'll learn about the NPM Repository, where most community extensions reside, and you'll learn how to publish your own extensions. In addition, the book outlines online resources for getting help with any stumbling blocks you run into during your journey as a Node developer.\nWHAT'S INSIDE",
